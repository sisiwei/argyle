# How to Play Argyle

Argyle is a new dynamic system that uses experience points and leveling up to encourage meaningful contributions. Use the tools at your disposal, including your strategic wit, to shape the conversation into one you’ll want to read.

Fill out your profile and return that to ______________________.

- The community will reward meaningful contributions with helpful, thoughtful, and positive stickers - these grant experience points (XP) to the author. Get enough XP and you’ll level up. Eventually, you may even unlock special badges and community swag.

- The community is more likely to reward wall posts you ruminate on. Take some time before you post.

- The community can punish toxic contributions - using off-topic, offensive, and poor attitude stickers will lower a contribution hit points (HP)! When HP reaches zero, the contribution is knocked out and hidden from view.

- Visit each other’s profiles to see their badges, featured comments, and connect further.

<i>Argyle, as a new system, is experiencing technical disruptions. XP and HP updates are currently lagging.</i>
