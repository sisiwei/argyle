# How to Play Argyle

Argyle uses experience points and leveling up to encourage meaningful discussion. Use the tools at your disposal, including your strategic wit, to shape this wall into something you’ll want to read and engage with.

First, fill out a user profile and return it to ______________________.

Second, grab a comment card and write your first post. When you’re done, tape it to the wall.

Third, see a comment that’s thoughtful, positive, or helpful? Tape the relevant emoji card onto the comment. Same if you feel a comment is offensive, off-topic or reflects a poor attitude.

Throughout the event, users will gain experience points (XP) if the community has rewarded their meaningful contributions with positive emojis. Get enough XP and users will level up and unlock special badges.

The community can also punish toxic contributions using the off-topic, offensive, and poor attitude emoji cards to lower a specific comment’s hit points (HP)! When HP reaches zero, the contribution is knocked out and hidden from view.

Visit the  ______________________ to see each other’s profiles and badges.
