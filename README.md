### First Create

- A prompt
	- This should be a should headline or topic that people at your event will have an opinion about. We recommend picking a prompt that takes a stance, as opposed to something that's open-ended. 
	- For example, we used `Olympics Reject 'Mind Sports' for 2020` with the subhed `No Chess Grandmasters or Pro Games Allowed in Tokyo`
