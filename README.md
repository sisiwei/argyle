### What you'll need:

- A large open wall in a central location
	- If you have a white board wall, great! If not, you'll need paper and tape to affix items to the wall.
- Normal tape
- Masking tape (optional)
- Post-its, normal-sized
- Post-its, small-sized

### First Create

- A prompt
	- This should be a should headline or topic that people at your event will have an opinion about. We recommend picking a prompt that takes a stance, as opposed to something that's open-ended. 
	- For example, we used `Olympics Reject 'Mind Sports' for 2020` with the subhed `No Chess Grandmasters or Pro Games Allowed in Tokyo`

- An article (optional)
	- Since we were originally testing how readers would respond to a news article, we also included a printed version of an article next to our prompt. Doing so also gave participants more points to disucss and debate.

### Assembly

1. Write your prompt at the top-most area of the wall, or write it on multiple sheets of paper and tape it to the wall. Participants should be able to read your prompt from a distance.

2. Beneath the prompt, draw a line (or draw the line on a long piece of mask tape). This will separate your prompt from the discussion.

3.
